### Hi there, I'm Josh 👋

I'm a Systems Engineer based in the UK with a keen interest in automation and generally learning as much as I can! Outside of my work life I am studying for a degree in engineering, and also spend my free time exploring the world of theatrical sound and lighting design.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning AWS tooling and services
- 👨‍💻 My preferred languages/tools are Python, bash and Ansible.
- 🌀 My operating system of choice is Debian (and Ubuntu)
