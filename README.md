### Hi there, I'm Josh 👋

I'm a Linux systems administrator based in the UK with a keen interest in automation and generally learning as much as I can! Outside of my work life I am studying for a degree in engineering, and spend a lot of spare time at my local community theatre as an amateur sound designer and technician.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on dedicated server provisioning and lifecycle management at [Mythic Beasts](https://www.mythic-beasts.com/)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Terraform and Golang
- 👨‍💻 My preferred languages/tools are Python, bash and Ansible.
- 🌀 My operating system of choice is Debian (and Ubuntu)
